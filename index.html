        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior at BYU studying Computer Science. I am from California
          and I love to work on cars and with electronics like Arduino or Raspberry 
          Pi. I also love to go hiking and camping. I am graduating this April and 
          plan to stay at BYU to get my masters in Cyber Security.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some experience with web programming, mostly in Vue. I have not worked
          with React before, but I have been wanting to learn it for a while. I am excited
          to learn more about it in this class.
